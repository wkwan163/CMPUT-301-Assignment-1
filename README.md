Cmput 301 Assignment 1 involves building an android app that allows the user to create claims composed of various expenses. The claims and expenses can be listed, viewed, and edited.

Design concepts from abramhindle's student-picker project at https://github.com/abramhindle/student-picker influenced various aspects of this project.
